# pglite-demos
Demos of pglite wasm

---

## Paul's notes:

To run:
```sh
http-server # install this if you don't have
```

Go to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/xterm.html
```

Refresh the browser for db based changes to take effect (since db lives in front end).

Commands to run:
```sh
select * from seeds; # shows json files that have been seeded the browser's db
select * from test; # shows actual data from the test table
```
